# Powerlevel10kDocker
A minimal example docker image using ubuntu with the romkatv/powerlevel10k zsh theme.

I highly reccomend downloading the reccomended fonts that go with the powerlevel10k theme. Download these fonts to the computer you will be using the terminal on. More information on the fonts you need to download them and how can be found here.
