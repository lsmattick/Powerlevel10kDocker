# Powerlevel10kDocker
A minimal example docker image using ubuntu with the romkatv/powerlevel10k zsh theme.

This git repo contains a minimal dockerfile to use the powerlevel10k theme in a docker container. For more information on the powerlevel10k zsh theme: https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#readme

I highly recommend downloading the recommended fonts that go with the powerlevel10k theme. Download these fonts to the computer you will be using the terminal on. More information on these can be found here: https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#fonts
